## Weather App

## Project Description
This Weather App allows users to check the current weather conditions of any city by entering the city name. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays the temperature, feels-like temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy), and min/max temperature. It also shows the current date and time, and features smooth animations with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).

## Features
- Input city name to get current weather information.
- Displays city, country, current date, temperature, feels-like temperature, weather conditions, and min/max temperatures.
- Uses the OpenWeather API for real-time weather data.
- GSAP animations for a smooth user experience.
- Styled background with an image from Unsplash for a modern look.
